# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is my attempt at the Kaggle's Titanic competition. The goal is to predict the survivability of passengers in the Titanic disaster.

The model that performed the best in this dataset was the Logistic Regression model and I managed to get an accuracy score of 0.77511 in my submission to Kaggle.
